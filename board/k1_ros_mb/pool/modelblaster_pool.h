 * modelblaster_pool — minimal raw-pthread parallel-for pool for the modelblaster
 * runtime. Drop-in replacement for the subset of pthreadpool that the
 * generated `parallel_<op>` wrappers actually use:
 *
 *     pthreadpool_create(N)             -> modelblaster_pool_create(N)
 *     pthreadpool_destroy(p)            -> modelblaster_pool_destroy(p)
 *     pthreadpool_get_threads_count(p)  -> modelblaster_pool_get_threads_count(p)
 *     pthreadpool_parallelize_1d(p, fn, ctx, range, flags)
 *                                       -> modelblaster_pool_parallelize_1d(...)
 *
 * The microbench in modelblaster/microbench/threadpool/ established that
 * pthreadpool's wrapper costs ~13 M target cycles per dispatch on the
 * FireSim quad-rocket-saturn build, while a raw pthreads + k_sem
 * rendezvous (the pattern this lib promotes from
 * bench_pthreads_raw.c) costs ~20k. That's a ~650x reduction in
 * dispatch overhead and is the entire motivation for this lib.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 *  - Workers are POSIX pthreads spawned at create time and pinned via
 *    pthread_attr_setaffinity_np (vendored Phase A patch — see
 *    modelblaster/harness_multi/zephyr_patches/posix-affinity.patch). We use
 *    pthreads, not k_thread, so the API stays portable to non-Zephyr
 *    builds; the bench measured the POSIX layer cost as essentially
 *    zero on top of k_thread.
 *
 *  - Zephyr uses `k_sem` for the rendezvous because the bench harness measured
 *    it as the cheapest cross-hart wakeup primitive there. Hosted Linux uses
 *    mutexes and condition variables behind the same API. Both ports pin
 *    helpers to the explicit hart set supplied by the schedule runtime.
 *
 *  - Master participates in its own slice (slice index 0). The master
 *    posts start sems for workers 1..N-1, runs slice 0, then takes done
 *    sems from workers 1..N-1. This matches pthreadpool's behavior
 *    where the calling thread is counted as one of the N workers.
 *
 *  - n_workers == 0 returns NULL. Callers (the codegen-emitted
 *    `parallel_<op>` wrappers) already check for NULL pool and run
 *    sequentially in that case — preserving the existing behavior with
 *    pthreadpool_create(0).
 *
 *  - n_workers == 1 returns a non-NULL pool whose
 *    modelblaster_pool_get_threads_count() reports 1; in that case
 *    parallelize_1d runs the function on the master with no fanout.
