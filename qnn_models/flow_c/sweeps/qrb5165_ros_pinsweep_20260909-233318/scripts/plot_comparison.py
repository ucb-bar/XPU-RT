"""ROS whole-network pinning vs XPU-RT scheduling, on the objective.

Supersedes `plots/ros_vs_xpurt_nonperiodic.png` for reporting. Same data,
three changes, each fixing something that made the first version misread:

  1. THE AXIS IS LOG. These are ratios. On a linear axis "2x slower" sits
     twice as far from 1.0 as "2x faster", so the eye reads the scheduler's
     wins as bigger than pinning's wins of identical magnitude. On log2 they
     are symmetric, which is the only honest way to draw a ratio.
  2. THE CLAIM IS SEPARATED FROM THE EXCLUSIONS. The first version sorted all
     42 cells into one column and greyed the 16 that are not part of the
     headline, which leaves the reader to do the exclusion themselves and
     invites reading a grey bar as a result. The 26 headline cells and the 16
     excluded ones are now different panels with their reasons named.
  3. THE MECHANISM IS ON THE FIGURE. The distribution is bimodal and the two
     tails have different causes; that is the finding, and it was previously
     only in the prose.

Colour is the reference palette's documented diverging pair (blue <-> red,
neutral grey midpoint), used unmodified. The skill's validator is a node
script and this host has no node, so inventing or re-stepping hexes here
would mean shipping unvalidated ones; the shipped pair is pre-validated.

  4. THE OPPONENT IS NAMED. The first version scored pinning against
     "the best measured solver", which sounds like the strongest possible
     opponent and on 30 of 42 cells was really greedy -- phase 4 of the XPU-RT
     sweep tiered by board time and only ran all twelve solvers on twelve
     cells. `--against warmbest` (the default) scores against cpsat:warmbest,
     which is what that study recommends for the offline path;
     `--against best` reproduces the older reading. Each writes its own file
     and says on the figure which one it is.
